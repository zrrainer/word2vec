# word2vec

the word2vec model is built in word2vec.ipynb. Inspired by a conversation with friends about internet memes, this project aims to investigate whether it is possible to pinpoint the semantic meaning of a made up slang word ("mulch", for example) by feeding sample usage of said word into a word2vec model and looking at its embedding? 


currently writing a web scraper using the Scrapy library. crawler/mulch/ contains the scraper, and outputs are saved in crawler/

launch the crawler with command "scrapy crawl [crawler name]" in the crawler directory.
