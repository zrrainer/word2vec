short history of bloodborne wiki
on 30th may 2014 i caught and watched with interest the project beast leaked material but it weren t till 9th june 2014 when project beast was revealed as bloodborne to the public that i started out of sheer awe 
plus from software and japan studio joined forces again first time after demon s souls
 to compile thread on demon s souls wikidot forums demonssouls info internet exploded with rumours and it seemed information about bloodborne was scattered all over the place felt limitations of forum thread were reached at the time so on 11th june 2014 blog for bloodborne news 
bloodbornenews blogspot com
 was created where i gathered and tried to verify every info that was out there until very close to the release blog was archived on 19th march 2015 
prior to that i definitely exhausted options of mere blog and was encouraged to continue with bloodborne info collecting especially while coming from years of experience from demon s souls wikidot wiki i believed i had what it takes to go out and create own wiki how i always envisioned it 
more visually pleasing more freedom on how to present information and no ads
and so on 22nd february 2015 bloodborne wiki com was created to paraphrase i was not prepared and first months after the release was bottleneck personal hell of mine just feeding wiki with information up to 16 hours a day it was probably up to one year or so when i felt i could raise my head and start enjoying it ever since i worked with glee and collaborated with countless of very talented and passionate members of this community 
would i start this project again gut reaction would be probably not but yes such project is too much for one person to create but i am enormously satisfied of what this passion project become and journey of getting there was definitely worth it 
i would like to express my gratitude to the community for the ride

beginner tips 
source
the below are things you should know that can make your journey through yharnam and the rest of the game easier you don t have to follow all of them to a t 
 get used to dying repeatedly it s normal just try to learn from your deaths 
 you cannot level until you gain a point of insight you can do that by running into your first boss or by finding and using an item called madman s knowledge you should prioritize this 
 try not to invest any points into bloodtinge or arcane on your first character those are much more nuanced stats with a higher learning curve and require you to know what you are doing to put them to full use you can totally beat the game with just vitality endurance strength and skill 
 read the game provided notes in the hunter s dream they provide information about the controls and other helpful hints the clinic you first wake up in has some as well 
 all weapons are viable find something with a moveset you like and enjoy it some weapons are more nuanced than others and require a more expert touch but you can defeat anything with any weapon if you know what you are doing with it you can even keep using your beginning weapon s from start to finish if you upgrade them periodically 
 clothing and their stats ultimately do not make a huge difference people call it fashionborne for a reason in general just wear what you think is cool at most you can stack gear that focuses on a particular element or resistance for specific situations and they will serve as a nice extra buffer outside of that there isn t a big difference between clothes other than how they look 
 explore explore explore you will often find gear and weapons lying about in more hidden corners you will definitely find items and whatnot to help you along the road also keep an eye out for 
shortcuts
 they will make your journey in yharnam so much easier 
 learn to 
parry
 parrying is when you shoot your firearm just as an enemy is striking when you do it right you will stagger them with a special sound and you can go up to them and press r1 for good damage with a 
visceral attack
 this doesn t work on every enemy but will make things much easier and epic against certain enemies and bosses try to practice in the first area and get a feel for it the brick trolls in central yharnam are great targets for this 
 practice the first area might feel like an extremely brutal start if you re new to souls style games but if you run around a bit to get a feel for the game you can get used to the style and combat you can also use the time to farm the currency and level up a bit 
 learn to take it slow and take on enemies one at a time if they re in a group try to lure individuals out pace yourself and learn when you should be cautious better safe than dead when you re more skilled then you can try to take on more opponents at once 
 have patience sometimes you will die in really pathetic ways or you will die just as you re about to beat some really tough boss it s normal to get frustrated but try to take a deep breath and figure out where you went wrong the worst thing you can do aside from smashing your ps4 is probably try to run back to whatever killed you in a fit of rage and either die to them due to recklessness or even die on the way back due to carelessness 
 do your own research this game has been out for about an year now and there is plenty of information out there if you re confused about something chances are that someone else has had the same problem put google to good use or search this sub for information 
 this is the most important guideline 
have fun
 the point of playing this game is to have fun so if you find something that people don t recommend but works for you go for it if you want to spend hours throwing yourself at a boss just because you like it go for it if you want to spend hours mopping up those mooks that used to kick your ass because it feels good go for it it s your game and your character so just make sure you re having fun

chalice dungeons 
by esper row with input from the tomb prospectors discord
getting started
what is a chalice dungeon 
 a chalice dungeon consists of three or four layers each containing a minor level culminating in a boss fight each layer tasks the hunter to navigate a series of underground ruins and find a lever that opens a locked gate to the boss so that they may proceed to the next floor and repeat the process until the dungeon s end the difficulty of a dungeon is dependent on its depth which is represented by a number from 1 5 with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest chalice dungeons are divided into two categories fixed dungeons also called story dungeons by the community and root dungeons 
how do i begin dungeon diving 
 the first obtainable chalice is the 
pthumeru chalice
 which is dropped by the 
blood starved beast
 in 
old yharnam
 the two 
ritual blood
 1 needed to create it are found earlier in the level on an altar in the building below djura to use it conduct the ritual at any of the six ritual altars to the left of the messenger shops in the 
hunter s dream
 this is where you will always be creating dungeons you will obtain more chalices by exploring pthumeru and defeating the optional bosses 
amygdala
 and 
ebrietas daughter of the cosmos
 in the main game 
what is the difference between a fixed dungeon and a root dungeon 
 a fixed dungeon can be considered the normal version of a chalice its map has set enemy item placements layouts and bosses all of which remain the same each time the dungeon is generated fixed dungeons are generally made once per character to unlock other chalices they contain and make them open to connect to for co op 
 a root dungeon will almost always be a different experience every time you create one when a root dungeon is generated the game pulls from a list of 100 200 pre generated dungeon maps for that chalice and spawns one of them each map will have a unique arrangement of rooms and differing placements of items enemies and bosses root chalices are never required for story dungeon progression but they are important to have for accessing glyphs later on 
when should i tackle the fixed dungeons 
depth 1
 is scaled to be accessible as soon as you defeat the 
blood starved beast
 so you can begin the journey immediately gehrman even encourages the hunter to do so a 3 weapon is good to have at this point which should be achievable with the abundance of blood stone shards scattered throughout the early game 
depth 2
 is a minor step up in enemy scaling from the previous depth most will be comfortable coming here directly after depth 1 although getting a handful of extra levels beforehand is wise 
depth 3
 sees a noticeable spike in difficulty and should be saved until after you reach 
yahar gul unseen village
 in the blood moon phase a 6 weapon at minimum is recommended 
depth 4
 is where the dungeons start to earn their infamy as this is where the ever popular 
defiled chalice
 resides enemy damage and health modifiers start to rival and even exceed the late game and dlc here so it s best to hold off on these dungeons until you reach the endgame in mensis and max out your main weapon at 10 for the defiled chalice in particular which comes with the twist of a cursed rite it s wise to have a high vitality stat at least 40 ideally and multiple 
clockwise metamorphosis
 runes 
depth 5
 amps the enemy scaling even further than depth 4 while the lack of a natural cursed rite makes the depth 5 fixed dungeons less punishing than the 
defiled chalice
 you should still expect a decent challenge here especially from pthumeru ihyll 
 if you choose to ignore the dungeons until after completing the main game and or dlc depths 1 3 will largely become a cakewalk due to their early and mid game difficulty that never scales with story progress or new game plus cycles making detours into the dungeons throughout a playthrough will provide more gems upgrade materials for the main story and prevent the monotony of blitzing through five or more easy dungeons all in a row during the endgame 
what are ritual materials 
ritual materials
 are ingredients used to create chalice dungeons the most basic ones are ritual blood and tomb mold which will be required for the majority of dungeons you make these materials are each separated into five levels represented by the number in their names the level of ritual blood tomb mold needed always corresponds to the dungeon s depth so the depth 1 pthumeru chalice requires ritual blood 1 and the pattern continues from there 
 as you descend to lower and lower depths you will need to gather higher quantities of increasingly rare materials for each dungeon made if you are following the game s intended dungeon progression exploring each fixed dungeon s layers and side areas thoroughly to find chests with materials is critical you may occasionally need to farm certain enemies for materials as well all materials will eventually become purchasable in the hunter s dream from the two messenger s shops by completing certain fixed dungeons and entering new game plus 
 the only material found exclusively outside of the dungeons is the 
living string
 which is needed for 
pthumeru ihyll
 and dropped by the 
brain of mensis
 on death as such it is recommended that you do not enter new game plus until you obtain this material as you will otherwise need to make your way back to mensis in new game plus to obtain it there is also a common bug associated with the brain that prevents it from dropping the living string while in co op however it should respawn after reloading the area 
what is the short root ritual chalice 
 the 
short root ritual chalice
 can be bought from the insight messenger bath for 10 insight after completing the first pthumeru fixed dungeon it enables use of the makeshift altar which comes with a handful of useful functions with it you can perform a quick search to open a random root dungeon you meet the entry requirements for resonate your bell to be summoned to a host seeking assistance or invade a dungeon with an active bell maiden as an adversary all directly from the hunter s dream this is a great tool for hunters looking to find random dungeons to explore and or participate with others in although the game s age and the altar s notoriously slow matchmaking usually make for long waiting times between sessions 
what are rites 
 rites are additional modifiers that can be added to a root dungeon each rite makes a dungeon more difficult but some also improve your rewards for exploring the lower the depth the more rites become available there are four in total that are available by the time you reach depth 5 
 the fetid rite will grant a red aura to several enemies throughout the dungeon increasing their damage output by 35 on the positive side these enemies will drop larger amounts of blood echoes and more rare items 
 the rotted rite will replace some enemies in the dungeon with one or a combination of the following new enemy types in every layer 
eye collectors
 who will aggressively summon 
mad ones
 in groups of three until killed
npc hunters of varying builds including saw spear hunter wearing the bone ash set chikage hunter wearing the cainhurst set logarius wheel hunter wearing the gold ardeo
roaming 
labyrinth ritekeepers
 each flanked by a small patrol of pthumerian watchers
 the cursed rite will halve the hunter s hp while they remain within the dungeon it also causes all enemies to drop cursed gems by default which have much stronger primary effects at the cost of a random negative effect like the fetid rite echo amounts and item drop rates from enemies are improved but the cursed rite also has a hidden effect that boosts the item discovery of any hunter with an eye or milkweed rune equipped by a staggering 1000 while cursed dungeons represent some of the most challenging content bloodborne has to offer they are always the most lucrative places to farm for blood gems and echoes 
 sinister rite will add a guaranteed 
bell ringer
 to every layer of the dungeon notably this rite is only available for separate sinister root chalices and cannot normally be stacked with the prior rites ringing either of the beckoning or sinister bells in a sinister dungeon will still spawn a second bell maiden allowing up to two invaders to join at once this rite provides no tangible improvements to rewards but it is handy for pvp centric hunters looking to set up fight clubs or run dungeons with the added twist of multiple invaders 
if they are entirely optional why even bother with the chalice dungeons 
 players looking to obtain bloodborne s platinum trophy must reach the 
pthumeru ihyll
 fixed dungeon to defeat 
yharnam pthumerian queen
 doing so via the intended path will require traversing the four previous pthumeru fixed dungeons and unless in new game plus two additional detours into other chalices for necessary materials 
 more dedicated hunters seek the dungeons for their powerful 
blood gems
 which trounce those found in the main game to give an example the strongest physical damage gems outside of the dungeons are 22 3 cursed temperings dropped by 
winter lanterns
 in the fishing hamlet in depth 5 cursed dungeons the 
merciless watchers
 can drop temperings as powerful as 27 2 providing a substantial leap in damage for any build optimizing any weapon in bloodborne will require varying amounts of time spent farming in the dungeons lowest depths 
 there are of course more reasons to go deeper the 
chalice dungeons
 are home to unique 
enemies
 and 
bosses
 not found anywhere in the base game or dlc many of which will pose a significant challenge to experienced hunters other benefits include finding uncanny or lost variants of each weapon with different gem slots the strongest versions of most runes from the main game the beast claw trick weapon two unique sets of attire efficient farming locations for blood echoes and the allure of finding bloodborne s greatest rarities 
dungeon navigation
how are chalice dungeons structured 
 as mentioned earlier a chalice dungeon consists of three or four layers each of these will have three distinct sections commonly referred to in order as the pre lamp the main area and the pre boss finally a layer will be capped off in an arena with a boss encounter 
 the pre lamp is the corridor leading from the beginning of the layer to the layer s starting lamp often there may be a bronze door or open doorway on one side of the hallway that leads to a side area these will always contain a well guarded treasure coffin with rare loot like ritual materials in fixed dungeons or caryll runes and weapon variants in root dungeons although these paths are optional for completing the dungeon itself their rewards are often enough to make them worth exploring especially if you are combing through the fixed dungeons 
 the main area is the middle section of a layer immediately following the lamp there will always be a locked gate near said lamp your task will be to find a lever within this section to unlock the gate and continue forward this lever will be found somewhere deep in the main area explore diligently and check every corner and closed door to find it once you have done so return to the start of the main area and open the gate to enter the pre boss 
 the pre boss is the corridor leading to the boss arena just like the pre lamp there may be a side area with a treasure coffin which will work the same way as a pre lamp side area the end of the layer will always have a boss fight defeat the boss proceed to the next layer and repeat the process until you reach the dungeon s end 
are there any deviations to this dungeon structure 
 the chalice dungeons occasionally throw small wrenches in the mix but the core progression of pre lamp main area pre boss boss will always remain the same the main area can contain its own bonus area and treasure coffin either behind a bronze door or through a seamless corridor transition the pre lamp and pre boss areas may also sometimes connect to the main area via alternate routes and in the case of the pre boss section this may even allow the hunter to bypass the locked gate and open it from the other side without ever touching the lever additionally unlike the main game illusory walls are present in two of the fixed dungeons and many of the root dungeons 
there is a chest in a doorway blocking my way forward what do i do 
 you can break it with your weapon or firearm this will take several swings but doing so will let you pass unlike dark souls ii breaking chests will not damage their items inside shotgun firearms like the blunderbuss are great for breaking chests quickly with their high ammo spread 
sharing and accessing glyphs
what is a glyph 
 when a hunter creates a root dungeon a unique eight character code will be generated for it visible in the bottom right corner of the dungeon menu think of this as a password that can be entered to access that dungeon again at any time to enter a glyph interact with any of the six ritual altars and select search by chalice glyph 
i just made an interesting glyph how do i make it open to others 
 interact with the ritual altar holding said dungeon and select the option to share it this will open access to other players once you have shared it with either an open or closed privacy setting 
what is the difference between a dungeon being open or closed 
 an open glyph can be entered by any player ringing at the makeshift altar allowing hunters to summon cooperators or be invaded by adversaries directly from the 
hunter s dream
 this is especially convenient for hunters looking to quickly help a friend on a lower layer of a difficult dungeon bear in mind that it takes much longer on average to be summoned from the makeshift altar than from inside the dungeon itself so be patient when waiting to connect 
 a closed dungeon can only be accessed by inputting its corresponding glyph at a ritual altar hunters will not be able to enter these dungeons with the makeshift altar and must instead ring their bells near the host s proximity on the same layer of that dungeon most save edited farming glyphs are closed 
why was my glyph deleted from the server 
 glyphs that are not routinely accessed by other hunters will eventually expire and be removed from the server presumably to maintain space for others while we do not fully understand the specifics of how this system works it typically takes around two weeks of inactivity for a glyph to be purged sadly there is no way to recover a glyph once it is gone if you want to keep your glyph alive as long as possible consider sharing it with friends and or the community on social media to increase the chances of other hunters accessing it 
why don t i meet the requirements for entering insert dungeon 
 two conditions must be met to enter any standard root dungeon 
first you must have already obtained the corresponding root chalice for the glyph you are trying to enter for instance pwmf22gu a classic farming glyph is a 
pthumeru ihyll
 so entering it requires the pthumeru ihyll root chalice or its sinister variant in hand 
second you must have previously generated dungeons with all of the same rites as the glyph you want to access creating a single root dungeon with the fetid rotted and cursed rites all applied is sufficient there is no need to complete this dungeon enter it or even keep it on an altar making such a dungeon will guarantee that you can enter glyphs with any combination of f r c rites so long as you also meet the first condition 
 note the same rule applies for the sinister rite therefore you must make your own sinister root dungeon with its rite enabled before having access to any sinister glyphs this is less important than the other rites as sinister chalices are never used for farming glyphs 
multiplayer interactions
is there any difference in how i connect to people for co op pvp in dungeons 
 the core fundamentals of bloodborne s summoning system remain the same the host rings the beckoning bell the cooperator rings their small resonant bell and both wait to connect if a bell maiden is present you will be notified of her ringing by a hud message and she will actively search for an adversary to invade your session until she is killed passwords carry over as well the only difference is that potential cooperators and adversaries have the option to search for sessions from the makeshift altar for added convenience 
why can t my friends connect to me in insert dungeon 
 bloodborne s bell summoning system is notoriously obtuse and finicky so there are a number of factors that could be tripping you up below is a list of details you can check for troubleshooting 
ensure you all have a matching password this sounds obvious but everybody forgets to switch their password from time to time 
set your matchmaking to worldwide if you have not already 
check to be sure the bell symbol under your hp and stamina bars isn t grayed out remaining on ladders or unstable ground like certain bridges will cross this icon out and prevent you from connecting 
if your cooperator is ringing into an open dungeon via the makeshift altar be mindful that the makeshift altar is infamously slow at matchmaking so do not expect to connect for at least a few minutes most of the time 
if you are in a closed dungeon make certain you are meeting the following criteria on top of the first two bullet points above 
all participants must ring on the same layer of the dungeon to connect 
ring in the same general area as your cooperator s e g if they are ringing on the stairs leading to the layer boss make sure you ring there too 
check what oath runes you and your cooperators are wearing 
executioners
 and 
vilebloods
 connecting to each other takes demonstrably longer than ringing with any other combination of runes 
hunter of hunters
 also appear to take longer to be summoned on average 
do 
covenants
 interactions carry over from the main game 
vilebloods
 and 
executioners
 will still be enemies when summoned onto the same team and 
hunter of hunters
 can enter as adversaries too the 
milkweed
beast s embrace
 and 
impurity
 runes are good choices to avoid unwanted interactions like these 
gem farming
is farming top tier blood gems from the dungeons worth the effort 
 while the uptick in damage between story blood gems and depth 5 cursed blood gems is substantial bloodborne s main story is entirely doable for most average players with story gems and top tier chalice gems are often seen as overkill this generally holds true for early new game plus cycles and the dlc as well 
 if you plan to engage in pvp with veterans run low depth cursed dungeons or go all the way to the highest new game plus difficulty then chalice gems will become more important for keeping up with skilled hunters and heavily scaled up enemies otherwise if you re only interested in a few casual playthroughs and don t care about pvp don t feel too pressured to optimize 
how and when do i get to farm top tier blood gems in the dungeons 
 all relevant farming glyphs are cursed depth 5 dungeons to reach them your priority is to obtain all three of the depth 5 root chalices and create your own root dungeon with all optional rites applied meeting these requirements will ensure your access to all farming glyphs for whatever blood gems you seek refer back to the final question of the 
sharing and accessing glyphs
 section for a more in depth explanation 
i m farming for insert gem and it hasn t dropped yet what gives 
 patience is a virtue and when it comes to gem farming it is also a necessity even with the improved drop rates in save edited farming glyphs many gem types are still very rare and can take many hours or days of dedicated farming to obtain 
what do all of the blood gem effects do 
 below is a summary of each primary gem type and what they re best used for 
 tempering
 boosts physical damage at an average rate these are very useful all rounder gems that work for any non arcane build even if they aren t always optimal 
adept
 boosts exclusively blunt or thrust damage at a higher rate than tempering these will be much more situational than tempering gems but if your weapon deals predominantly or exclusively blunt thrust damage these provide a generous boost in damage as a side note bear in mind that visceral attacks inflict thrust damage meaning that thrust adepts will make them stronger while blunt adepts will provide no benefit for them at all 
nourishing
 boosts all damage at a lower rate than tempering the lower numbers might look less appealing on the surface but if your weapon has a mixture of physical and elemental damage these will boost both damage types and sometimes outperform tempering gems importantly blood damage is considered a type of physical damage for the sake of blood gems so temperings will still boost blood damage higher than a nourishing will provide 
striking
 greatly boosts damage dealt exclusively by fully charged strong attacks these gems are very situational and gimmicky but for weapons with already potent charged attacks like the stake driver using these can make for a fun meme worthy build arcane builds using element converted weapons will see no benefit from striking gems as their effects only impact physical charged attack damage 
radiant
 reduces all stamina consumption of a weapon s moveset these gems are essentially useless due to the already low stamina consumption on bloodborne s weapons across the board and added damage always being preferable 
fool s
 boosts damage exclusively while the hunter is at full hp at a higher rate than tempering fool s can either boost physical damage alone like tempering gems or all damage as nourishing gems do if you re confident in your ability to fight unscathed in pve fool s gems can provide a decent chunk of extra damage in pvp however they are ill advised due to factors like latency and the fast pace of fights making it extremely difficult to maintain these gems effect against experienced duelists 
poorman s
 boosts damage exclusively while the hunter is below 30 hp at a higher rate than almost all other blood gems like fool s poorman s can also drop as either tempering or nourishing effects these gems are inherently risky by forcing a glass cannon playstyle but for very knowledgeable players especially challenge runners they are very appealing for providing some of the highest damage possible in bloodborne 
beasthunter kinhunter
 boosts damage exclusively against enemies that are classified as beasts or kin respectively while these gems appear stronger than tempering gems in raw value beasthunter and kinhunter effects are calculated after enemy defense is applied to your hits making them weaker in practice this on top of their situational applications and difficulty in farming makes these gems unappealing to most 
heavy
 improves the weapon s strength scaling heavy abyssal gems provide such a massive increase in scaling that hunters on high level strength or quality builds will want to get one of them for most of their weapons 
sharp
 improves the weapon s skill scaling due to a lack of any depth 5 boss at layer 3 or lower that drops sharp abyssals on par with heavy abyssals any available sharp gems are always worse than temperings and should never be farmed 
warm
 improves the weapon s bloodtinge scaling for the same reason as sharp gems these are entirely useless 
cold
 improves the weapon s arcane scaling these gems are crucial for arcane builds as most convertible weapons have low arcane scaling to begin with 
pulsing
 steadily regenerates hp by a small amount every 2 seconds the regeneration rate is very slow and not worth sacrificing your main weapon s damage for but if you are using a build that doesn t care about gun damage putting one on your firearm can help save a blood vial or two in a pinch 
murky
 enables the weapon to inflict the slow poison status and improves the build up rate the abundance of bosses with high poison resistance renders these situational to begin with and slow poison itself drains hp too slowly to compete with the raw damage provided by other blood gems 
dirty
 enables the weapon to inflict the rapid poison status and improves the build up rate the same issue with murky gems applies here although rapid poison is a significantly stronger effect akin to the bleed status in other souls games and can be decent on weapons with fast multi hit attacks against the handful of enemies that are weak to poison 
fire bolt arcane
 converts a pure physical damage weapon to the corresponding element and changes its scaling to exclusively arcane for arcane builds these gems are important for changing your damage type from physical to elemental and allowing your weapon to scale off of arcane 
bloodtinge
 boosts exclusively blood damage at a higher rate than tempering while exceptionally tedious to farm in shapes other than circle these gems are very potent for the tricked modes of the bloodletter and chikage while also being a staple for any high damage firearm 
what blood gems will be best for my weapon build 
 given the large variety of 
blood gems
weapons
 and possible 
builds
 this is a hard question to give a general answer for the 
best blood gems setups
 page on the bloodborne wiki is a good starting resource for checking what you should be aiming for on each weapon if you want a more direct answer you can ask in the 
tomb prospectors subreddit
 or 
discord server
 for input from other prospectors 
what are abyssal blood gems 
 abyssal gems have the highest rank of any gem in bloodborne and are greatly sought after by the more dedicated prospectors in the community each boss on layers 3 or 4 at depth 5 will have a 33 chance to drop an abyssal gem of their corresponding type abyssals are not always the best of their kind and not every gem type can be normally obtained as one but many builds do require some for optimal damage especially those incorporating strength and or arcane save scumming is recommended for farming abyssal gems as a hunter would otherwise need to reset the dungeon and run back to layer 3 or 4 for every farming attempt 
 notably there are a few exceptions to the normal abyssal rule 
pthumerian descendant
 at layers 3 or 4 in cursed dungeons cannot drop abyssal gems additionally descendant and the 
pthumerian elder
 drop tempering abyssals at layers 1 and 2 these instances are attributed to mistakes or bugs rather than intentional decisions on the developers part 
what is save scumming 
 save scumming involves making a back up save when farming bosses which cuts out the need to redo the dungeon after the boss is killed to start save scumming proceed through a dungeon to the boss you re looking to farm save and quit immediately in front of the boss gate and upload your save within your console s cloud settings or on a separate usb drive re enter the game and defeat the boss if you get the gem you re looking for then you are good to move on if not go back into the settings and download back the save you just made this will place you back where you were originally with the boss alive again letting you repeat the process until you get your desired gem drop 
does item discovery help for farming gems 
 the answer depends on what you are farming discovery has no impact on the quality of gem drops so its only use is helping those gems drop at all since all depth 5 bosses in root dungeons have a 100 chance to drop a gem to begin with it will not help you with theirs however for mobs who regularly have consumables and materials in their drop tables tacking on an 
eye
 and or 
milkweed
 rune will make their gems drop more frequently 
i see the phrase unable to acquire goodname due to inventory or storage max while farming is this something to worry about 
 no this is a harmless side effect from save editing dungeons it s a broken drop script attempting to give you an item that does not exist you can safely disregard this message 
what do oos and ooe mean 
 oos stands for out of shape this refers to when a gem drops in a shape that is not native to the corresponding chalice radial in pthumeru triangle in hintertomb isz and waning in loran the chances of this happening are significantly lower than in the main game thus oos gems found in dungeons are very valuable especially when dropped from bosses bloodtinge gems in particular are highly prized as oos drops for the 
bloodletter
 and 
chikage
 as these are almost exclusively dropped as circle shape otherwise the only enemies that drop gems with their own distinct shapes regardless of the chalice are the 
beast possessed soul
 enemy version not the boss and mobs spawned by the rotted rite 
 ooe stands for out of effect this refers to primary and secondary effects on blood gems that are not native to the gempool of that chalice in layman s terms they are extremely rare effects you will practically never see for instance while obtaining a bloodtinge gem from the merciless watchers boss in unedited pthumeru ihyll is technically possible the chance of it happening is 0 008 an astronomically low possibility that few will ever see 
what is a gempool 
 each chalice has its own gempool which determines all of the possible primary and secondary effects each gem dropped can have and their likelihood in unedited dungeons pthumeru will provide gems impacting physical damage and support effects and hintertomb is mostly the same with a slightly higher emphasis on poison meanwhile loran leans more heavily into elemental damage and poison gems while isz is generally a mix of everything despite its chalices item descriptions suggesting mostly arcane effects 
 with save editing some players can share dungeons with tweaked gempools that make obtaining certain gems in different shapes much easier than normal and also sometimes improve drop rates altogether see the following section and question for more information 
save edited dungeons
what is a save edited dungeon 
save edited dungeons
 are made by players with access to a third party save editing program allowing them to make limited modifications to a dungeon most commonly save editors are used to create dungeons with improved drop rates for blood gems that would normally be very challenging to obtain it is important to note that while this is quite beneficial for farming certain gems it is impossible to manually input custom drop rates into a dungeon with a save editor at best we can only work with what is already programmed into the game so some gems still remain tedious to farm 
 additional uses for save editing include 
creating false depth and reverse depth dungeons
stacking multiples of the cursed rite for increased item and blood echo drops
accessing developer test dungeons
changing what enemies are spawned by the rotted rite or spawning all of them at once
forcing a dungeon s fourth layer open
spawning the beast possessed soul mob and or the chalice messenger bath
what is a test dungeon 
 test dungeons are broken and incomplete dungeons that contain significant amounts of cut content including architecture mobs and even bosses that were all left inaccessible in the final release these provide a unique opportunity to see content that was once planned for the finished game before being scrapped those with a save editor are able to recreate these maps as glyphs and share them publicly for the broader player base to explore while they do not usually provide checkpoints for you to warp back to the hunter s dream simply falling to your death in one of the many pitfalls of these dungeons will do the trick just make sure to spend your echoes before entering if you don t want to lose them in the process 
what are false depth and reverse depth dungeons 
 false depth dungeons are lower depth dungeons that have been edited to be accessible much earlier than intended they can be found via glyphs once you have obtained the 
pthumeru root chalice
 from layer 2 of the first fixed dungeon these allow you to obtain uncanny lost variants of base game weapons tier 3 runes powerful 
blood gems
 and even skip directly into later depth fixed dungeons to unlock the best farming glyphs within hours of creating a new character 
 reverse depth dungeons are depth 1 2 root dungeons that have been edited so that enemies drop late game upgrade materials namely 
blood stone chunks
 and 
blood rocks
 from bosses these glyphs are vital for farming these rare resources as the bosses will be scaled for early game health and damage output making them pushovers for any decent build chunks can be farmed from any boss and rocks from the layer 3 and lower bosses of a reverse depth be sure to equip an 
eye
 or 
milkweed
 rune to improve the drop rates of these materials 
 these dungeons greatly streamline the buildmaking process cutting down the time investment needed to reach the depth 5 dungeons and making farming easier however for hunters venturing into the chalices for the first time these glyphs will sour the experience by overloading them with a ludicrous amount of echoes that far outpace the game s intended leveling curve while also letting them skip large amounts of content entirely for these reasons new players should look into save edited dungeons very sparingly or not at all until a later playthrough 
are there any malicious save edited dungeons i should be concerned about and if so how can i identify them 
 unfortunately there are a few problematic test dungeons that have been made open for anyone to access these dungeons have no lamps to leave or cracks in the architecture to force a death by gravity permanently trapping any character that enters some of these dungeons can be escaped naturally if playing on the european game of the year edition but they still remain dangerous on all other versions of the game in january 2022 a glitch was discovered by the community that allows players to confuse the character s spawn point in dungeons which can be applied to escape deadly test dungeons an explanation of the glitch and instructions on how to use it for this purpose can be found in this 
reddit post
 while this discovery does mean that these dungeons are no longer true softlocks you should generally avoid any unknown dungeon that has these traits in its menu 
broken descriptions names with placename or menutext text
depth 0 6 7 or 8 dungeons 
multiples of the same rite applied or has the sinister rite stacked with other rites
glitches exploits and softlocks
i m trapped in a boss room with a pthumerian descendant how do i get out 
 see if you have a save file backed up on the playstation cloud or on a separate usb drive from before you entered this dungeon you may lose some progress but this will let you restore your character to a safe spot if you don t have one available your only option is to use a glitch to force yourself out you can find guides about how to execute it 
here
what is the dungeon merging glitch 
 the dungeon merging glitch was discovered in early 2022 and its applications are versatile to simplify an extremely complicated exploit the dungeon merging glitch requires placing one character in a specific spot in a dungeon and using a second character to quit from a co op or invasion session when executed correctly this will cause the first character to be launched into another predetermined dungeon which retains the gem shapes effects and values from the dungeon they were initially set up in this glitch is quite difficult to explain in short terms so for a more involved explanation see the 
dungeon merging tab in the bloodsheets
 this glitch is chiefly used to force the game to provide blood gems that are normally very tedious to farm such as out of shape abyssals from bosses like amygdala and the bloodletting beast it also allows one to farm abyssal gems that are normally impossible to obtain such as flat arcane gems from brainsuckers and other gem types like adept fool s poorman s and many more the dungeon merging glitch can also be used to escape test dungeons that can otherwise soft lock players as explained in the previous section 
what on earth is the cum dungeon 
 the infamous cum dungeon cummmfpk is a save edited dungeon created by long time prospector xtrin that exploits an unfortunate enemy placement and the way bloodborne progressively loads its level assets in the pre lamp side area of this dungeon s first layer a tomb prospector npc is placed directly in the path of a swinging axe that continually damages him because the game doesn t fully load the pre lamp area until you get close to it remaining in the hallway outside causes this npc to remain stuck in place while the axe quickly kills him providing an efficient effort free source of blood echoes the dungeon has also been edited to have multiple cursed rites stacked together which greatly enhances the amount of echoes obtained this is why your hp is in double digits territory while inside 
 for a more visual explanation from an expert on how souls games work modder and content creator zullie the witch has 
a short video
 explaining cummmfpk s exploit as well 
i m not getting free echoes from cummmfpk why 
 cummmfpk s echo farming exploit works so long as you do not approach the layer 1 pre lamp side area due to the way bloodborne gradually loads npc s and objects based on distance if you get too close to that area it will be further loaded and the npc hunter that would be killed by repeated axe swings will instead be knocked off and take no further damage taking a step or two out from the chamber of the seal lamp and looking for the damage numbers in the distance to your left is all you need to do 
miscellaneous
did the community ever figure out what the deal was with 
guidance
 tier 3 and 
revered great one coldblood
 both exist in the game s data and are fully functional but neither can be obtained without modding on a jailbroken console or a save editor while both were mentioned as lootable from depth 5 root dungeons by an official guide a complete exploration of every root dungeon has proven this to be false 
does the 
yharnam stone
 do anything 
a cut set of dialogue
 for the hamlet priest npc that would have been triggered by having the yharnam stone was discovered but this event was not kept in the final release of the dlc the stone is best looked at as a testament to conquering the story dungeons and nothing more 
are the chalice dungeons affected by ng cycles 
 chalice difficulty is never affected by new game cycles and your progress will not be impacted by going to the next cycle either if you enter a new new game cycle all of your chalices will be on the same altars they were when you completed the game 
can 
yharnam pthumerian queen
 be found in the root dungeons 
 yharnam is exclusive to the fixed pthumeru ihyll dungeon 
can i get uncanny lost variants of dlc weapons before entering the dlc 
 dlc weapons uncanny and lost variants are only unlocked at chalice messenger baths after you obtain their original versions from the dlc campaign there is no way to save edit weapons to appear at chalice merchants earlier than normal 
i heard that everything in the dungeons has been found is this true 
 with two complete rounds of community mapping for every root dungeon in the books and modders digging into the game s files for years it s safe to say that every major secret in the dungeons has been laid bare it s very possible that there are other glitches and exploits yet to be found but groundbreaking discoveries like new enemies and bosses are a thing of the past 
how to access dlc the old hunters
step 1

story prologue
 located in a remote mountainous region far away from the rest of civilization there s the ancient city of yharnam it s a gloomy city where the indigenous faith has given birth to prejudice but it s also known as a center of ancient medical learning many bizarre secrets are hidden within its dark depths 
 however the city is now affected by the horrifying epidemic commonly named the plague of the beast and is now known as a cursed place those afflicted transform into hideous beasts the citizens around are unaware that they too are afflicted even the so called normal humans rare in number might have their own share of abnormalities to contend with deep down 
 today in the city of yharnam the beast hunt happens every night and the streets are filled of the smell of blood beasts and death there s a peculiar atmosphere as the crowds performing the beast hunt wander around the city they walk around with bleary confused eyes with their weapons and torches in their hands 
 the beasts are great in strength and fast on foot it is best to watch the beasts movements and think of the best strategy of how to take them on 
 there are those that burn the bodies of huge beasts a cruel feast unfolds under the beautiful moon but what do these people have in common with the beasts that answer is unknown at this very time 
 there are people who hunt down the beasts for a living and they are called hunters their equipment includes a unique weapon that has the shape of a saw mixed with a hatchet as well as a shotgun to take down the beasts 
 armor is obsolete and so hunters use a different battle technique to fight their battles the shotgun is used for far away encounters whilst their unique weapon is used for up close battles this is how the hunters fight when the time comes to overcome dangerous situation they must persevere to stay alive in many life and death struggles 
 from here on out bet your life as your ghastly battle for your life will begin

basic information
introduction
 starting 24th november 2015 experience the nightmare of the hunters who once guarded byrgenwerth s deepest darkest secrets and uncover the mystery behind yharnam s sinister past and in the old hunters expansion dlc for bloodborne journey to a world where hunters from the past are trapped forever find multiple new outfits and weapons to add to your hunter arsenal and explore brand new stages full of dangers rewards and deadly beasts to hunt 
patch 1 07
 prior to the launch of the dlc all bloodborne owners will receive free title 
update 1 07
 which adds new features and drastically changes the online component of the game the patch goes live november 20 2015 so remember to update your game and try out the new features 
when to dive in
 although you can access the hunter s nightmare as soon as the game time advances to night tackling the new areas this early would pose a severe challenge you would be at a serious disadvantage against the powerful enemies and bosses that await for a more balanced experience a minimum blood level of 80 with at least one right hand weapon upgraded to 9 is recommended this means either heading into the hunter s nightmare after clearing most of the areas in the main game or after considerable chalice dungeon play that said speedrunners and challenge enthusiasts will find no shortage of opportunities to flex their muscles in these areas by entering as early as possible 
hunters drunk with blood have lost their dream an endless hunt and the secrets it hides

ludwig the holy blade
defeat the beast that was once ludwig the holy blade 
ludwig can be a very difficult fight so it s recommended that you go to the forbidden woods and speak with valtr to join the league and get the impurity caryll rune with that rune equipped you ll be able to summon valtr and younger twin madaras to aid you in the boss fight making it much easier they will provide a much stronger assistance against ludwig than old hunter henriett who can be summoned behind the nightmare church after defeating him either cleave his remaining head or wear church garb and speak to it answering yes to his question to receive the holy moonlight sword which you ll need for the old hunter s essence trophy 
lady maria of the astral clocktower
defeat lady maria of the astral clocktower 
you ll be able to face lady maria straight after beating the living failures and she is a powerful and relentless foe make sure to bring a left handed firearm that is good for interrupts as they ll offer one of the best ways of damaging her if you have more than one clawmark caryll rune it s worth stacking them on your character at the memory altar in the hunter s dream to increase your visceral attack damage after an interrupt 
living failures
defeat the failed attempts to become great ones 
to reach the living failures you ll need to make your way to the very top of the research hall and activate the staircase mechanism to move the stairs only then will you be able to access the door to this boss if you have killed yamamura in his cell thus freeing him from captivity you will be able to summon him outside the en trance to the boss area and he can assist you greatly in this battle 
laurence the first vicar
defeat the beast that was once laurence the first vicar 
before you can face laurence in battle you must first find his skull which is well hidden on a secret altar beneath the surgery altar in the recovery room to access the hidden altar you will need to step onto the surgery altar so that it starts to go up and then quickly run off it so that you land back in the room once the elevator comes to a stop the hidden altar will be revealed and you ll be able to recover laurence s skull with the skull in hand you ll be able to initiate the battle with laurence by returning it to him in the nightmare grand cathedral which of course is in the hunter s nightmare the mighty valtr can once again aid you in this battle if you have joined the league and have the impurity rune equipped you ll find his summon sign just inside the cathedral 
dlc notes
