basic information
left hand weapons
the old hunters expansion left hand weapons
firearm data
frame data
key
firearms are wielded with the left hand and employed in beast hunting 
basic information
as with primary weapons you can equip two left hand weapons at once and you can swap between them by pressing left usually you ll use a gun in your left hand but sometimes you may want a torch or shield left hand weapons are also referred to as off hand weapons sidearms and in the case of guns firearms generally speaking guns are a reliable form of ranged attack most of them scale with your bloodtinge stat that said different guns are effective at different ranges and tasks and some even scale with arcane rather than bloodtinge 
a passive effect like hp recovery in your gun is active even if you are currently equipped two handed mode of any of your weapon 
beware
 equipping your firearm with any elemental blood gem arcane bolt fire will prevent you from 
buffing
 your right hand weapon despite it being buffable physical damage
