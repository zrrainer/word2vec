Well, perhaps you could help me all the same? I can't move at all, I'm afraid. But I need Brain Fluid. Murky, mushy Brain Fluid. Help me hear the sticky sound, I've gone so long without it... 
Please, could you do something for me? I need Brain Fluid. Murky, mushy Brain Fluid... 
The murky, mushy fluid that will make me whole. The sticky sound whispers to me. So very close, right into my ear.
