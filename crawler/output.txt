short history of bloodborne wiki
on 30th may 2014 i caught and watched with interest the project beast leaked material but it weren t till 9th june 2014 when project beast was revealed as bloodborne to the public that i started out of sheer awe 
plus from software and japan studio joined forces again first time after demon s souls
 to compile thread on demon s souls wikidot forums demonssouls info internet exploded with rumours and it seemed information about bloodborne was scattered all over the place felt limitations of forum thread were reached at the time so on 11th june 2014 blog for bloodborne news 
bloodbornenews blogspot com
 was created where i gathered and tried to verify every info that was out there until very close to the release blog was archived on 19th march 2015 
prior to that i definitely exhausted options of mere blog and was encouraged to continue with bloodborne info collecting especially while coming from years of experience from demon s souls wikidot wiki i believed i had what it takes to go out and create own wiki how i always envisioned it 
more visually pleasing more freedom on how to present information and no ads
and so on 22nd february 2015 bloodborne wiki com was created to paraphrase i was not prepared and first months after the release was bottleneck personal hell of mine just feeding wiki with information up to 16 hours a day it was probably up to one year or so when i felt i could raise my head and start enjoying it ever since i worked with glee and collaborated with countless of very talented and passionate members of this community 
would i start this project again gut reaction would be probably not but yes such project is too much for one person to create but i am enormously satisfied of what this passion project become and journey of getting there was definitely worth it 
i would like to express my gratitude to the community for the ride
